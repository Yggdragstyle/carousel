# C A R O U S E L

Simple carousel (slider) Front-End.
Modular, light, styleless (without css, but if you need you can pickup the basic demo stylesheet)

Use a configurable data attribute or classname for driven your slider.
Or, use a basic JS/JSON configuration. (basically, use it for override)

## Contributing

Use the .env for local demo server port, (whish is handle by local server and Cypress E2E tests)
